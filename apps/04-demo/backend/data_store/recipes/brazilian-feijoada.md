## Description
Feijoada is Brazil's national dish, a hearty black bean stew loaded with various cuts of pork. This comfort food has its origins in Portuguese cuisine but has evolved into a uniquely Brazilian dish. The combination of tender beans, succulent meat, and traditional accompaniments creates a complete meal. The dish is traditionally served on Saturdays and at celebrations, accompanied by rice, collard greens, farofa (toasted manioc flour), and orange slices, which help digestion.
