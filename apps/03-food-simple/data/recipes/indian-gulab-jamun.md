## Description
Gulab Jamun is one of India's most popular desserts, featuring soft, milk-based dough balls that are fried until golden and soaked in aromatic sugar syrup. The name comes from the Persian words "gul" (rose) and "ab" (water), referring to the rose-scented syrup. When properly made, the jamuns are light, spongy, and melt in your mouth, while the syrup provides sweetness and delicate floral notes from the rose water and cardamom. This dessert is a staple at Indian festivals and celebrations.
