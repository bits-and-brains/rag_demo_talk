## Description
Panna Cotta, meaning "cooked cream" in Italian, is a silky smooth dessert from the Piedmont region of Italy. This elegant dessert features a delicate vanilla-infused cream set with just enough gelatin to hold its shape while maintaining a luxuriously smooth, trembling texture. The bright, slightly tart berry sauce provides a perfect contrast to the rich, creamy dessert. Simple yet sophisticated, Panna Cotta is a perfect ending to any meal.
