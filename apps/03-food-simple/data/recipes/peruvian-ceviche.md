## Description
Ceviche is Peru's national dish, a fresh and vibrant preparation of raw fish "cooked" in citrus juice. The acid in the lime juice chemically cooks the fish, while the combination of onions, chili peppers, and cilantro adds layers of flavor. The dish is traditionally served with sweet potato and corn, which provide a sweet contrast to the acidic fish. This refreshing dish is perfect for hot days and is often enjoyed as an appetizer or light lunch along the Peruvian coast.
